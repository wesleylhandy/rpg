### Background Image Credit

This site is purely for educational purposes, particularly to highly the use of jQuery in manipulating html DOM elements. Character images and Star Wars logo were obtained through wikipedia site searches. The background image came from [Movie Screencaps.com](http://caps.pictures/198/0-starwars5/full/star-wars5-movie-screencaps.com-13195.jpg)
